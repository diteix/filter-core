# filter-core [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

`FilterCore` is a project that I developed trying to abstract the predicate of LINQ to attributes and classes.
I have used an old and obsolete version of this code for .NET and for the sake of learning, I decided to create a better version for .NET Core and share it via GitHub.

You can use it as you like, respecting MIT license.
